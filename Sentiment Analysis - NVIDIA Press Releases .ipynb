    "From humble beginnings as a university spinoff to an acquisition by the leading global medtech company in its field, Odin Vision has been on an accelerated journey since its founding less than five years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alum of the NVIDIA Inception program for cutting-edge startups, Odin Vision builds cloud-connected AI software that helps clinicians detect and characterize areas of concern during endoscopy, a procedure where a tiny camera mounted on a tube is inserted into the gastrointestinal tract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network-connected devices in the endoscopy room capture and stream real-time video data to the cloud, where powerful NVIDIA GPUs run AI inference. The models’ results are then streamed back to the endoscopy room so that clinicians can see the AI insights overlaid on the live video feed with minimal latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The startup was in 2022 acquired by Japanese medtech leader Olympus, which has a 70% global market share in gastrointestinal endoscopic equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We believe the acquisition brings us much closer to achieving our vision to revolutionize endoscopy through AI and cloud technology,” said Daniel Toth, cofounder and chief technology officer of Odin Vision. “Our software can reach Olympus’ global customer base, enabling us to bring our solutions to as many patients as possible.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Olympus is also collaborating with NVIDIA on Olympus Office Hours, an advisory program that connects Inception startups with the medical device company’s experts, who will offer deep industry expertise and guidance to help the startups build AI solutions in key areas including gastroenterology, urology and surgery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eight leading AI startups have joined the inaugural cohort of the program — which is part of the NVIDIA Inception Alliance for Healthcare, an initiative that brings together medical AI startups with NVIDIA and its healthcare industry partners — to help accelerate their product development and go-to-market goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Extra Set of AIs for Clinicians\n",
    "Around a quarter of precancerous polyps are missed during colonoscopies, a kind of endoscopy procedure that examines the lower digestive tract.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some are missed because the endoscope doesn’t capture video footage of every angle, others remain undetected by clinicians. That’s where AI can help provide a second set of eyes to support clinical decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seamless AI integration into the video feeds that medical professionals view during an endoscopy provides an extra data source that can help doctors detect and remove polyps sooner, helping prevent cancer development.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Polyps develop slowly, and can take five or 10 years to appear as cancer,” Toth said. “If a clinician can detect and remove them in time, it can help save lives.”\n",
    "\n",
    "CADDIE, the company’s AI software for detecting and classifying polyps, has received the CE Mark of regulatory approval in Europe and is deployed across hospitals in the U.K., Spain, Germany, Poland and Italy — with plans for use in the U.S as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Odin Vision also has AI software that has received the CE Mark to assist gastroscopy, where doctors inspect the esophagus for signs of throat cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accelerated Inference for Real-Time Insights\n",
    "Odin Vision began as a research project by two professors and a Ph.D. student at University College London who were developing AI techniques for polyp detection. In 2019, they teamed with Toth and Odin’s CEO, Peter Mountney, both from Siemens Healthineers, to commercialize their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "“NVIDIA GPUs were part of our work from the start — they’ve been essential to train our AI models and were part of our first product prototypes for inference, too,” Toth said. “Since moving to a cloud-based deployment, we’ve begun using the NVIDIA Triton Inference Server for dynamic processing in the cloud.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The team uses NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs for accelerated inference — most recently transitioning to NVIDIA L4 GPUs. Adopting NVIDIA Triton Inference Server software and the NVIDIA TensorRT software development kit enabled them to meet the low-latency threshold needed for real-time video-processing AI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to supporting doctors during specific procedures, Odin Vision plans to develop generative AI models that can automate a first draft of the clinical notes doctors prepare afterward — as well as models that can aggregate data across procedures. These would allow endoscopy teams to review analytics and assess how well a procedure is performed compared to clinical guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Once you get to a point where there are dozens of AI models tracking different elements of these procedures, we can see if a healthcare professional is inspecting a particular area of the digestive tract for only three minutes, when it’s supposed to take six minutes,” Toth said. “The system can provide a nudge to remind the clinician to follow the guidelines.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud-Connected Cancer Screening\n",
    "Membership in NVIDIA Inception provided the Odin Vision team access to technical expertise from NVIDIA and cloud credits through leading cloud service providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Cloud credits helped us massively speed up our technology development and deployment, enabling us to release our products to market months earlier than initially planned,” Toth said. “NVIDIA experts also validated our product concept from a technology perspective and provided consultation about GPU and accelerated software optimizations.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The team found that a cloud-based solution made it easier to push software updates over the air to deployments across hospital customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Some AI companies are sending boxes that need to sit in clinical sites and require regular maintenance, which can prevent normal clinical workflows from running smoothly,” Toth said. “With network-connected devices, we can instead update a single server and the changes reach all end users at the same time.”\n",

    "NVIDIA researchers have pumped a double shot of acceleration into their latest text-to-3D generative AI model, dubbed LATTE3D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a virtual 3D printer, LATTE3D turns text prompts into 3D representations of objects and animals within a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crafted in a popular format used for standard rendering applications, the generated shapes can be easily served up in virtual environments for developing video games, ad campaigns, design projects or virtual training grounds for robotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A year ago, it took an hour for AI models to generate 3D visuals of this quality — and the current state of the art is now around 10 to 12 seconds,” said Sanja Fidler, vice president of AI research at NVIDIA, whose Toronto-based AI lab team developed LATTE3D. “We can now produce results an order of magnitude faster, putting near-real-time text-to-3D generation within reach for creators across industries.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This advancement means that LATTE3D can produce 3D shapes near instantly when running inference on a single GPU, such as the NVIDIA RTX A6000, which was used for the NVIDIA Research demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideate, Generate, Iterate: Shortening the Cycle\n",
    "Instead of starting a design from scratch or combing through a 3D asset library, a creator could use LATTE3D to generate detailed objects as quickly as ideas pop into their head.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model generates a few different 3D shape options based on each text prompt, giving a creator options. Selected objects can be optimized for higher quality within a few minutes. Then, users can export the shape into graphics software applications or platforms such as NVIDIA Omniverse, which enables Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)-based 3D workflows and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the researchers trained LATTE3D on two specific datasets — animals and everyday objects — developers could use the same model architecture to train the AI on other data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "If trained on a dataset of 3D plants, for example, a version of LATTE3D could help a landscape designer quickly fill out a garden rendering with trees, flowering bushes and succulents while brainstorming with a client. If trained on household objects, the model could generate items to fill in 3D simulations of homes, which developers could use to train personal assistant robots before they’re tested and deployed in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "LATTE3D was trained using NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. In addition to 3D shapes, the model was trained on diverse text prompts generated using ChatGPT to improve the model’s ability to handle the various phrases a user might come up with to describe a particular 3D object — for example, understanding that prompts featuring various canine species should all generate doglike shapes.\n",

    "Imagine a world where you can whisper your digital wishes into your device, and poof, it happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "That world may be coming sooner than you think. But if you’re worried about AI doing your thinking for you, you might be waiting for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fireside chat Wednesday at NVIDIA GTC, the global AI conference, Kanjun Qiu, CEO of Imbue, and Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at NVIDIA, challenged many of the clichés that have long dominated conversations about AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Launched in October 2022, Imbue made headlines with its Series B fundraiser last year, raising over $200 million at a $1 billion valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bridging the Gap Between ‘Idea and Execution’\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion highlighted not only Imbue’s approach toward building practical AI agents able to automate menial, unrewarding work, but also painted a vivid picture of what the next chapter in AI innovation might hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Our lives are full of so much friction … every single person’s vision can come to life,” Qiu said. “The barrier between idea and execution can be much smaller.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Catanzaro’s reflections on the practical difficulties of using AI for simple tasks, such as his own challenges trying to get his digital assistant to help him find his next meeting, underscored the current limitations in human-AI interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that figuring out where and when to go to a meeting, while easy for a human assistant, isn’t easy to automate.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We tend to underestimate the things that we do naturally and overestimate the things that require reasoning,” Catanzaro observed. “One of the things humans deal with well is ambiguity.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This set the stage for a broader discussion of the need for AI to move beyond mere code generation and become a dynamic, intuitive interface between humans and computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiu said the idea that AI can be a magical assistant, one that knows everything about you “isn’t necessarily the right paradigm.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s because delegation is hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "“When I’m delegating something, even to a human, I have to think a lot about ‘okay, how can I package this up so that the person will do the right thing?’”\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the better model might be telling your computer to do anything you want. So you’re “telling your computer to do stuff and the agent is a middle layer,” she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such agents will need to be able to interact with people — something often described as “reasoning,” the two observed — and communicate with computers — or “code.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A Vision for Empowerment Through Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiu and Catanzaro — who often completed each other’s sentences during the 45-minute conversation — compared AI’s potential to democratize software creation to the Industrial Revolution’s impact on manufacturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parts needed for a steam engine, for example, once took years to create. Now they can be ordered off the shelf for a small sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both speakers emphasized the importance of creating intuitive interfaces that allow individuals from nontechnical backgrounds to engage with computers more effectively, fostering a more inclusive digital landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means going beyond coding, which is done in text-heavy environments such as an Integrated Development Environment, or even using text-based chats.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The interface to agents, a lot of them today, is like a chat interface. It’s not a very good interface, in a lot of ways, very restrictive. And so there are much better ways of working with these systems,” Qiu said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Future of Personal Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiu and Catanzaro discussed the role that virtual worlds will play in this, and how they could serve as interfaces for human-technology interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think it’s pretty clear that AI is going to help build virtual worlds,” said Catanzaro. “I think the maybe more controversial part is virtual worlds are going to be necessary for humans to interact with AI.”\n",
    "\n",
    "People have an almost primal fear of being displaced, Catanzaro said, but what’s much more likely is that our capabilities will be amplified as the technology fades into the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Catanzaro compared it to the adoption of electricity. A century ago, people talked a lot about electricity. Now that it’s ubiquitous, it’s no longer the focus of broader conversations, even as it makes our day-to-day lives better.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think of it as really being able to [help us] control information environments … once we have control over information environments, we’ll feel a lot more empowered,” Qiu said. “Every single person’s vision can come to life.”\n",

    "Chart of NVIDIA Hopper GPUs with TensorRT-LLM on MLPerf Inference GPT-J\n",
    "\n",
    "Raising the Bar in Generative AI\n",
    "TensorRT-LLM running on NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs — the latest, memory-enhanced Hopper GPUs — delivered the fastest performance running inference in MLPerf’s biggest test of generative AI to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new benchmark uses the largest version of Llama 2, a state-of-the-art large language model packing 70 billion parameters. The model is more than 10x larger than the GPT-J LLM first used in the September benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory-enhanced H200 GPUs, in their MLPerf debut, used TensorRT-LLM to produce up to 31,000 tokens/second, a record on MLPerf’s Llama 2 benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "The H200 GPU results include up to 14% gains from a custom thermal solution. It’s one example of innovations beyond standard air cooling that systems builders are applying to their NVIDIA MGX designs to take the performance of Hopper GPUs to new heights.\n",

    "In addition, NVIDIA Jetson Orin remains at the forefront in MLPerf’s edge category. In the last two inference rounds, Orin ran the most diverse set of models in the category, including GPT-J and Stable Diffusion XL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLPerf benchmarks cover today’s most popular AI workloads and scenarios, including generative AI, recommendation systems, natural language processing, speech and computer vision.

    "\n",
    "NVIDIA engineers used a technique called structured sparsity — a way of reducing calculations, first introduced with NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs — to deliver up to 33% speedups on inference with Llama 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second open division test found inference speedups of up to 40% using pruning, a way of simplifying an AI model — in this case, an LLM — to increase inference throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an optimization called DeepCache reduced the math required for inference with the Stable Diffusion XL model, accelerating performance by a whopping 74%.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these results were run on NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs.\n",
    "\n",

    "NVIDIA’s partners participate in MLPerf because they know it’s a valuable tool for customers evaluating AI systems and services. Partners submitting results on the NVIDIA AI platform in this round included ASUS, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Fujitsu, GIGABYTE, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, Microsoft Azure, Oracle, QCT, Supermicro, VMware (recently acquired by Broadcom) and Wiwynn.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the software NVIDIA used in the tests is available in the MLPerf repository. These optimizations are continuously folded into containers available on NGC, NVIDIA’s software hub for GPU applications, as well as NVIDIA AI Enterprise — a secure, supported platform that includes NIM inference microservices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Next Big Thing  \n",
    "The use cases, model sizes and datasets for generative AI continue to expand. That’s why MLPerf continues to evolve, adding real-world tests with popular models like Llama 2 70B and Stable Diffusion XL.\n",
    "\n",

    "Imagine a world where you can whisper your digital wishes into your device, and poof, it happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "That world may be coming sooner than you think. But if you’re worried about AI doing your thinking for you, you might be waiting for a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fireside chat Wednesday at NVIDIA GTC, the global AI conference, Kanjun Qiu, CEO of Imbue, and Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at NVIDIA, challenged many of the clichés that have long dominated conversations about AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Launched in October 2022, Imbue made headlines with its Series B fundraiser last year, raising over $200 million at a $1 billion valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bridging the Gap Between ‘Idea and Execution’\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion highlighted not only Imbue’s approach toward building practical AI agents able to automate menial, unrewarding work, but also painted a vivid picture of what the next chapter in AI innovation might hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Our lives are full of so much friction … every single person’s vision can come to life,” Qiu said. “The barrier between idea and execution can be much smaller.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Catanzaro’s reflections on the practical difficulties of using AI for simple tasks, such as his own challenges trying to get his digital assistant to help him find his next meeting, underscored the current limitations in human-AI interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that figuring out where and when to go to a meeting, while easy for a human assistant, isn’t easy to automate.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We tend to underestimate the things that we do naturally and overestimate the things that require reasoning,” Catanzaro observed. “One of the things humans deal with well is ambiguity.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This set the stage for a broader discussion of the need for AI to move beyond mere code generation and become a dynamic, intuitive interface between humans and computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiu said the idea that AI can be a magical assistant, one that knows everything about you “isn’t necessarily the right paradigm.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s because delegation is hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "“When I’m delegating something, even to a human, I have to think a lot about ‘okay, how can I package this up so that the person will do the right thing?’”\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the better model might be telling your computer to do anything you want. So you’re “telling your computer to do stuff and the agent is a middle layer,” she said.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such agents will need to be able to interact with people — something often described as “reasoning,” the two observed — and communicate with computers — or “code.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A Vision for Empowerment Through Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiu and Catanzaro — who often completed each other’s sentences during the 45-minute conversation — compared AI’s potential to democratize software creation to the Industrial Revolution’s impact on manufacturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parts needed for a steam engine, for example, once took years to create. Now they can be ordered off the shelf for a small sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both speakers emphasized the importance of creating intuitive interfaces that allow individuals from nontechnical backgrounds to engage with computers more effectively, fostering a more inclusive digital landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means going beyond coding, which is done in text-heavy environments such as an Integrated Development Environment, or even using text-based chats.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The interface to agents, a lot of them today, is like a chat interface. It’s not a very good interface, in a lot of ways, very restrictive. And so there are much better ways of working with these systems,” Qiu said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Future of Personal Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiu and Catanzaro discussed the role that virtual worlds will play in this, and how they could serve as interfaces for human-technology interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think it’s pretty clear that AI is going to help build virtual worlds,” said Catanzaro. “I think the maybe more controversial part is virtual worlds are going to be necessary for humans to interact with AI.”\n",
    "\n",
    "People have an almost primal fear of being displaced, Catanzaro said, but what’s much more likely is that our capabilities will be amplified as the technology fades into the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "Catanzaro compared it to the adoption of electricity. A century ago, people talked a lot about electricity. Now that it’s ubiquitous, it’s no longer the focus of broader conversations, even as it makes our day-to-day lives better.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think of it as really being able to [help us] control information environments … once we have control over information environments, we’ll feel a lot more empowered,” Qiu said. “Every single person’s vision can come to life.”\"\"\"\n",

    "NVIDIA researchers have pumped a double shot of acceleration into their latest text-to-3D generative AI model, dubbed LATTE3D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a virtual 3D printer, LATTE3D turns text prompts into 3D representations of objects and animals within a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crafted in a popular format used for standard rendering applications, the generated shapes can be easily served up in virtual environments for developing video games, ad campaigns, design projects or virtual training grounds for robotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "“A year ago, it took an hour for AI models to generate 3D visuals of this quality — and the current state of the art is now around 10 to 12 seconds,” said Sanja Fidler, vice president of AI research at NVIDIA, whose Toronto-based AI lab team developed LATTE3D. “We can now produce results an order of magnitude faster, putting near-real-time text-to-3D generation within reach for creators across industries.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This advancement means that LATTE3D can produce 3D shapes near instantly when running inference on a single GPU, such as the NVIDIA RTX A6000, which was used for the NVIDIA Research demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideate, Generate, Iterate: Shortening the Cycle\n",
    "Instead of starting a design from scratch or combing through a 3D asset library, a creator could use LATTE3D to generate detailed objects as quickly as ideas pop into their head.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model generates a few different 3D shape options based on each text prompt, giving a creator options. Selected objects can be optimized for higher quality within a few minutes. Then, users can export the shape into graphics software applications or platforms such as NVIDIA Omniverse, which enables Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD)-based 3D workflows and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the researchers trained LATTE3D on two specific datasets — animals and everyday objects — developers could use the same model architecture to train the AI on other data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "If trained on a dataset of 3D plants, for example, a version of LATTE3D could help a landscape designer quickly fill out a garden rendering with trees, flowering bushes and succulents while brainstorming with a client. If trained on household objects, the model could generate items to fill in 3D simulations of homes, which developers could use to train personal assistant robots before they’re tested and deployed in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "LATTE3D was trained using NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs. In addition to 3D shapes, the model was trained on diverse text prompts generated using ChatGPT to improve the model’s ability to handle the various phrases a user might come up with to describe a particular 3D object — for example, understanding that prompts featuring various canine species should all generate doglike shapes.\n",

    "Of GTC’s 900+ sessions, the most wildly popular was a conversation hosted by NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang with seven of the authors of the legendary research paper that introduced the aptly named transformer — a neural network architecture that went on to change the deep learning landscape and enable today’s era of generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Everything that we’re enjoying today can be traced back to that moment,” Huang said to a packed room with hundreds of attendees, who heard him speak with the authors of “Attention Is All You Need.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharing the stage for the first time, the research luminaries reflected on the factors that led to their original paper, which has been cited more than 100,000 times since it was first published and presented at the NeurIPS AI conference. They also discussed their latest projects and offered insights into future directions for the field of generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "While they started as Google researchers, the collaborators are now spread across the industry, most as founders of their own AI companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We have a whole industry that is grateful for the work that you guys did,” Huang said.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From L to R: Lukasz Kaiser, Noam Shazeer, Aidan Gomez, Jensen Huang, Llion Jones, Jakob Uszkoreit, Ashish Vaswani and Illia Polosukhin.\n",
    "Origins of the Transformer Model\n",
    "The research team initially sought to overcome the limitations of recurrent neural networks, or RNNs, which were then the state of the art for processing language data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noam Shazeer, cofounder and CEO of Character.AI, compared RNNs to the steam engine and transformers to the improved efficiency of internal combustion.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We could have done the industrial revolution on the steam engine, but it would just have been a pain,” he said. “Things went way, way better with internal combustion.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Now we’re just waiting for the fusion,” quipped Illia Polosukhin, cofounder of blockchain company NEAR Protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper’s title came from a realization that attention mechanisms — an element of neural networks that enable them to determine the relationship between different parts of input data — were the most critical component of their model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We had very recently started throwing bits of the model away, just to see how much worse it would get. And to our surprise it started getting better,” said Llion Jones, cofounder and chief technology officer at Sakana AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a name as general as “transformers” spoke to the team’s ambitions to build AI models that could process and transform every data type — including text, images, audio, tensors and biological data.\n",
    "\n",
    "“That North Star, it was there on day zero, and so it’s been really exciting and gratifying to watch that come to fruition,” said Aidan Gomez, cofounder and CEO of Cohere. “We’re actually seeing it happen now.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Packed house at the San Jose Convention Center.\n",
    "Envisioning the Road Ahead \n",
    "Adaptive computation, where a model adjusts how much computing power is used based on the complexity of a given problem, is a key factor the researchers see improving in future AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s really about spending the right amount of effort and ultimately energy on a given problem,” said Jakob Uszkoreit, cofounder and CEO of biological software company Inceptive. “You don’t want to spend too much on a problem that’s easy or too little on a problem that’s hard.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A math problem like two plus two, for example, shouldn’t be run through a trillion-parameter transformer model — it should run on a basic calculator, the group agreed.\n",
    "\n",
    "They’re also looking forward to the next generation of AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think the world needs something better than the transformer,” said Gomez. “I think all of us here hope it gets succeeded by something that will carry us to a new plateau of performance.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“You don’t want to miss these next 10 years,” Huang said. “Unbelievable new capabilities will be invented.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversation concluded with Huang presenting each researcher with a framed cover plate of the NVIDIA DGX-1 AI supercomputer, signed with the message, “You transformed the world.”\n",
